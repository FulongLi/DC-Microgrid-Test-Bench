Checking integrity of Schematic and Pcb designs in project "CurrentTransducer"
==============================================================================

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:


Component 'ADP122AUJZ-2.5-R7' package 'SOT95P280X100-5N' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.

Value "Farnell Part Number" on component instance "IC4" caused by library item mismatch.

Value "Farnell Price/Stock" on component instance "IC4" caused by library item mismatch.

Use Update to reload Component "ADP122AUJZ-2.5-R7" to add/alter Value "RS Part Number"
Use Update to reload Component "ADP122AUJZ-2.5-R7" to add/alter Value "RS Price/Stock"
Use Update to reload Component "ADP122AUJZ-2.5-R7" to add/alter Value "Datasheet Link"
