Checking integrity of Schematic and Pcb designs in project "ControlBoard"
=========================================================================

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:


Disconnect Pin IC2-1 from Net "+5V"

Component 'TPS75933KTTT' package 'TO170P1524X483-6N' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.

Value "Mouser Part Number" on component instance "IC5" caused by library item mismatch.

Value "Mouser Price/Stock" on component instance "IC5" caused by library item mismatch.

Use Update to reload Component "TPS75933KTTT" to add/alter Value "RS Part Number"
Use Update to reload Component "TPS75933KTTT" to add/alter Value "RS Price/Stock"
Use Update to reload Component "TPS75933KTTT" to add/alter Value "Datasheet Link"
